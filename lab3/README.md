# ðŸ’» Lab 3: Computer Architecture Tools â€“ Part II

This lab focuses on identifying performance bottlenecks using two tools: `perf` and IntelÂ® VTuneâ„¢ Profiler. You will compile backend and frontend bottleneck binaries and then analyze them to understand where CPU time is being spent.

- **Backend Bottleneck**: Occurs when the CPU is ready to execute instructions but is stalled waiting for data, typically due to memory latency or limited bandwidth.
- **Frontend Bottleneck**: Happens when the CPU cannot fetch or decode instructions fast enough, often caused by instruction cache misses or branch mispredictions.

## ðŸ§© Task 0: Collecting the Program Binaries

### ðŸ”¹ 0.1 Backend Bottleneck Binary (Matrix Multiplication)

1. Navigate to the backend bottleneck source directory:
   ```
   cd lab3/backend_bottleneck/linux
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```
   make
   ```

3. Return to the parent directory:
   ```
      cd ..
   ```

- âœ… This generates a binary named `matrix` which will be used for performance analysis with `perf` and VTune.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 0.2 Frontend Bottleneck Binary

1. Navigate to the frontend bottleneck source directory:
   ```
   cd lab3/frontend_bottleneck/
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```
   make
   ```

- âœ… This generates a binary named `fb_b` which will also be used for performance analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Task 1: Using `perf` Tool

### ðŸ”¸ 1.1 List Available Performance Events

To view the full list of events supported by your system:

```
perf list
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ 1.2 Run `perf stat` on a Compiled Binary

To measure performance statistics:

```
perf stat -e <event_list> ./binary
```

- Replace `<event_list>` with specific hardware/software events (or omit to use default).
- Replace `./binary` with `./matrix` or `./fb_b` depending on what you're analyzing.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Task 2: Using IntelÂ® VTuneâ„¢ Profiler

1. Launch IntelÂ® VTuneâ„¢ Profiler.

2. Choose an analysis type (e.g., **Hotspots**, **Microarchitecture Exploration**, etc.).

3. Select the binary (`matrix` or `fb_b`) as the target application.

4. Run the analysis.

5. Explore the results to identify CPU, memory, or frontend/backend pipeline bottlenecks.

## âœ… Summary

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Use `perf` to capture basic performance metrics.
- Use IntelÂ® VTuneâ„¢ to perform in-depth profiling and identify bottlenecks.
